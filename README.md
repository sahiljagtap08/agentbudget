AgentBudget is the ulimit for AI agents. Just like Unix systems have ulimit to prevent a single process from consuming all system resources, AgentBudget prevents a single agent session from consuming your entire AI budget. It's not a platform. It's not a dashboard. It's a guard rail - small, focused, and essential.
